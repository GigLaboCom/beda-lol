(append entries below, newest last)

### S00 — Repository bootstrap — 2026-09-25
- Done: archive moved to `archive/` and `docs/` (plus `docs/tactics/`, `docs/BOOTSTRAP.md`), Claude Code kit in place; root config (`.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.node-version`, MIT `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `nx.json`, `biome.json`), `Taskfile.yml` with stub tasks, `.gitkeep` dirs, ADR 0001.
- Deviations from step/spec: **Nx instead of Turborepo** (`nx.json` instead of `turbo.json`; the human asked for Nx on the frontend) — step files S00, S05, S13 and `CLAUDE.md` updated. **Domain `beda.lol`** instead of `beda.giglabo.com` (the repo is `GigLaboCom/beda-lol` and its README names beda.lol); spec docs keep the old name, step files and `CLAUDE.md` use the new one. OWNER = `GigLaboCom`. `_import/` was never created: the archive was unpacked straight into place.
- New deps: `nx` 23 (task orchestration, replaces turbo), `@biomejs/biome` 2.5 (lint/format, named in the step). pnpm pinned to 10.33.0 via `packageManager`.
- Follow-ups: none.
- [HUMAN] open: none.

### S01 — Rust API skeleton — 2026-09-25
- Done: Cargo workspace at the root (edition 2024, shared lints: `unsafe_code = forbid`, clippy pedantic), `rust-toolchain.toml`, crate `beda-api` in `apps/api` with `serve` / `admin` (stub) / `healthcheck` (raw TCP probe of `/api/readyz`) / `version`; typed env config reporting all problems at once; tracing (JSON in prod); middleware stack request id → trace → propagate id → 64 KiB body limit → 15 s timeout → catch panic; `AppError` with the `{"error":{"code","message"}}` shape (also used for 404 fallback and panics); graceful shutdown with 10 s drain. Tests: healthz, request id generated/echoed, 413, panic → 500, config parsing. `deny.toml`. The API is also an Nx project (`apps/api/project.json`: build, test, lint, deny, dev) so `nx run-many -t test` covers Rust too.
- Deviations from step/spec: toolchain pinned to 1.94.1 (the version available in the build environment; bump in a follow-up). `clippy.toml` allows `unwrap`/`expect` in tests. Timeout answers 503 (`TimeoutLayer::with_status_code`).
- New deps: tokio, axum 0.8, tower, tower-http 0.7, tracing, tracing-subscriber, serde, serde_json, thiserror, anyhow, clap, uuid (all named in the step); dev: http-body-util (read bodies in tests).
- Follow-ups: install `watchexec` locally for `task api:dev`.
- [HUMAN] open: none.
